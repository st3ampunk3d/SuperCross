# Overview
### What This App Does
This program is the beginning of a SuperCross Fantasy League Mobile app. It parses rider and event details from [supercrosslive.com](http://supercrosslive.com)
and allows the user to rank the riders in the order they think the riders will place.

### Why I Wrote It
This is my first dive into Java/Kotlin. The goal is to develop it into a fully functional Android App. The idea behind the app is very simple; it seemed like
a good project to start out with. I learned about loops, when statements, and recursive function calls that greatly simplified the code. These differed from the
programming languages I was already familiar with.

### See It in Action
I made a quick [demo video](https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/index.php/extwidget/preview/partner_id/1157612/uiconf_id/42438192/entry_id/1_mdimiiga/embed/dynamic) that walks through the code and my approach to solve the problem. 

# Development Environment
### IntelliJ by JetBrains
This is my new favorite IDE. The interface is clean and intuitive. I love that there's a spell checker integrated.

### Kotlin v1.8.10
Kotlin is still a pretty new programming language. From what I understand, it expands and simplifies Java.
Learning the basic syntax was pretty easy.

### JSoup - Java HTML Parser
JSoup is a Java library for HTML parsing. A great think about Kotlin is that it is completely compatible with Java libraries.

# Useful Websites
This was a learning experience for me. I spent lots of time in tutorials and searching the web while I got the hang of it.

# Future Work
This project is just the start of the app.

Some of the things that still need to happen are:
- Save the User's picks to .json or db
- Compare the User's picks to the actual event results and calculate points
- Create a GUI for the mobile app
- Package the app for distribution
